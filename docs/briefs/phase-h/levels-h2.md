# Phase H2 brief: Levels (far actors)

# Context (read carefully)
You are the **Levels (far actors)** team on "Knotz Bizarre Escape", a fan remake of an old pygame shooter as a **Phaser 4.2.1 + TypeScript + Vite** run-and-gun aiming at **Metal Slug 1–3 / Contra** quality (384×216 internal, pixel art, 16 px tiles, Arcade physics).
- **Repo:** /home/knotz2/code/KnotzBizarreEscape/KnotzBizarreEscape. The game is in `game/`. Branch `mission-2`.
- **Shared checkout:** other teams are working in the same checkout right now.
- **Status:** Missions 1 and 2 are built, and the owner loves them. **Phase H** is a visual polish pass. It brings the newer
  enemies up to (or above) the quality of the rest of the game's art before Mission 3 starts.

**Read first, in this order:**
1. `docs/PHASE-H.md`: the owner's ask, the Lead's survey, the phase rules and the shared contract. Read all of it.
2. `docs/ART-STYLE.md`: the house pixel style. `docs/LESSONS.md`: the definition of done.
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (ownership, events, debug hooks) and `docs/PHASER4-RULES.md` (Phaser 4 API rules).
4. Your own notes in `docs/teams/<your team>.md`. Reuse your pipelines, helpers and tools.

**The Lead's survey images** are in `/tmp/kbe-lead/polish/` (read-only for you):
- `hopper.png`, `airboat.png`, `buzzard.png`, `small.png`: the current sprites per tag.
- `ref.png`: grunt, shield and lurker, which are the bar for the soldiers.
- `bosses1.png` and `bosses2.png`.
- In-game shots: `ctx_*.png`, `e_*.png`, `b_*.png`.

# Rules
- **Edit only the paths your team owns** (ARCHITECTURE.md, plus anything this brief grants). Need something else? List it
  under **"Requests for other teams"** in your report.
- **No git commands that change state:** no commit, add, checkout, stash, reset or restore. The Lead commits.
- **Don't touch the repo-root `playtest/` folder.** The Lead refreshes it.
- **Other teams' work in progress:**
  - Transient typecheck errors in their files are expected; don't touch their files.
  - At the end, run `npm --prefix game run check` and make sure **your** files are clean. Report foreign errors briefly.
- **Testing (the owner's hard rule): NO real-time bot playthroughs.**
  - Use `npm --prefix game run check`, `npm --prefix game run audit`, `npm --prefix game run selftest`,
    `?enemytest=<kind>` fixtures, `__KBE.sim.advance(ms)` (fixed-step turbo), `__KBE.cheats.*`, and targeted
    `game/tools/shot.mjs` screenshots and contact sheets.
  - **Open and look at** every image you cite.
  - **Time-box each verification attempt to about 10 minutes.** If a check won't converge, stop and report it.
  - SwiftShader is slow when several browsers run at once. Run your captures **one at a time** (one browser, many pages)
    rather than many shot.mjs processes in parallel. If a shot shows a loading screen, wait longer instead of retrying in parallel.
- **Scratch output:** `/tmp/kbe-levels/`.
- **Shell:**
  - `cd` is aliased by fnm and errors. Use `builtin cd`, absolute paths, or `npm --prefix game ...`.
  - **Never** use `pkill -f` or `killall` with patterns. Kill by PID.
  - Stop every dev server or browser you start before you finish.
  - If a local server start is refused ("approval reviewer at capacity"), wait 30–60 s and retry once, then fall back to `shot.mjs` or report it.
- **Browser:** `game/tools/shot.mjs` already sets up Chromium (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/knotz2/.local/opt/chromium-libs/root/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, SwiftShader). Shot tips:
  - wrap `scene.start` evals in `(…, 1)`;
  - use unique shot names;
  - allow about 1.2 s of boot, longer for Mission 2 (it loads its packs on demand).
  - URL pattern: `?debug=1&scene=Game&fast=1&mute=1&god=1&part=2-1&x=2640` (part and world x). `debug=1` also draws hurtboxes.
- **Python** (Pillow/numpy): `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/kbe-imagegen/uv-cache /home/knotz2/.local/bin/uv run --offline --with pillow,numpy python3 -I <script>`.
- **Pixel art:**
  - Aseprite is at `/home/knotz2/.local/bin/aseprite` (guide: `/home/knotz2/.local/opt/pixel-tools/PIXEL-TOOLS.md`).
  - Master palette only (`docs/palette.gpl`, `K.PAL` in `game/tools/aseprite/kbe.lua`), binary alpha.
  - **Aseprite tags are global animation keys:** prefix every tag with its sprite key and check for duplicates.
  - Build with `bash game/tools/build-art.sh <lua>`.
- **Quality bar:** it has to look like Metal Slug. Silhouettes read at 1×, there's life in every idle, telegraphs are fair,
  impacts are juicy, and it holds 60 FPS on SwiftShader. Reduced-flash and screen-shake settings are respected.
- **When done:**
  - Append a **Phase H** section to your team notes file: what you built (paths), how to see it (exact URLs or commands), decisions and known issues.
  - Your **final reply** is a concise report:
    - what you built;
    - the verification evidence (paths of the images you inspected, and the check, audit and selftest results);
    - known issues;
    - **Requests for other teams**.

# Your Phase H2 job: Levels, far background actors that match the new enemy designs
**Ownership:** your usual Levels paths (`src/level/**`, `config/tuning/level.ts`, maps, `art-src/maps/**`,
`art-src/backgrounds/actors/**`, `sprites/bg/**`, your packs, `docs/teams/level.md`).

**Why:** Phase H rebuilt the Buzzard gunship, the airboat and the gnat (the mech mosquito drone) from Imagegen references, so your far actors
now show old designs. Match the new ones, at far scale, in your house far-actor style (no outlines, atmospheric palette, low
contrast, alive):
1. **`bg_buzzard`** (the `buzzard_circle` moment in 1-2; check for other uses). It should read as the new gunship far away:
   the canopy blob, a long tail boom, a rotor blur and a tail rotor flicker. New sprite: `game/public/assets/sprites/enemies/buzzard.png`
   plus its `.json`. Reference: `game/art-src/refs/buzzard/`.
2. **`bg_airboat`** (the `airboat_race` moment in 2-2): the big fan cage with a spinning blade, two crew bumps and a pennant,
   plus a wake. New sprite: `sprites/enemies/airboat.*`. Reference: `refs/airboat/`.
3. **`bg_skeeter`** (the `skeeter_swarm` moment: mech mosquito drones crossing the moon): match the new **gnat** (`sprites/enemies/gnat.*`, `refs/gnat/`).
   Enemies B is redrawing the MEGA-SKEETER boss right now. If any far actor of yours shows the boss itself, match `refs/skeeter/`.

Keep the sizes about the same as today (they're tuned for the far layers and the screen y 62–110 sky band) unless the new
silhouettes need a few pixels more. Keep the frame budget small.

**Evidence:**
- an old/new contact sheet at 1× and 4×;
- in-context shots of each moment, fired with `__KBE.cheats.bg('<id>')` in its real part: `buzzard_circle`, `airboat_race`, `skeeter_swarm`.

Run `npm --prefix game run audit` at the end.

**"Anything else" (optional, time-boxed to about 20 minutes):** look through your other far actors and background moments in Missions 1–2
for anything that now looks off next to the facelifted enemies, and fix it if it's yours. List what you changed.
